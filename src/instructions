    To Run :
        cmake -S . -B build         # to create the build directory
        cd build                    # go inside the build directory
        make                        # building the code (compiling)
        ./querk ../input.qrk        # run with input file (compiling input file)
        ./out                       # running executable
        echo $?                     # checking output

        
=> first rename the file to main.cpp (or as mentioned in CMakeLists.txt)
